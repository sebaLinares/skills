# Docs Catalog

Entry point for AI context. Read this before any task requiring repo knowledge.
When you add a doc, add a one-line entry to the matching section.

## Repo-root anchors

Top-level docs that live at the repo root, not under `docs/`.

- [`/AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) — agent entry point: operating principle, hard
  constraints, phase gates, session bootstrap. `CLAUDE.md` symlinks to it.
- [`/ARCHITECTURE.md`](../ARCHITECTURE.md) — code map: layout, module pattern,
  dependency direction, bootstrap, hotspots.
- [`/SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md) — security posture: reporting, dependency
  scanning, secrets, auth, trust boundaries.

## Specs and plans

Spec-kit is the active artifact pipeline. Plan-driven work is authorized by
`specs/<feature>/plan.md`.

- `../specs/` — active and completed feature specs, plans, tasks, and design
  artifacts.
- [`PLANS.md`](PLANS.md) — the plan style contract for `specs/<feature>/plan.md`.

## Decisions (ADRs)

- [`decisions/harness-design.md`](decisions/harness-design.md) — why this
  harness exists and what ships.
- [`decisions/speckit-harness-integration.md`](decisions/speckit-harness-integration.md)
  — spec-kit as artifact pipeline, harness as governance layer.
- [`decisions/adr-slug-canonical.md`](decisions/adr-slug-canonical.md) — ADR
  slugs as the canonical identifier.

## Processes

- [`processes/harness.md`](processes/harness.md) — the operating manual.
- [`processes/speckit-loop.md`](processes/speckit-loop.md) — the per-feature
  loop runbook.
- [`processes/dev-setup.md`](processes/dev-setup.md) — toolchain, commands, and
  the plan-coverage check wiring.

## Trackers

- [`tech-debt-tracker.md`](tech-debt-tracker.md) — known hazards and deferred
  work.
- [`HARNESS-TODO.md`](HARNESS-TODO.md) — non-blocking checklist of harness
  skeletons the team still needs to fill (delete once all boxes are ticked).
